You can locate it via photographs but that's about it. No one goes here and no one leaves. Right in our own neighborhood. I can assure you that its just not an institution that wants any kind of profile. It wants *your* profile; if anything. Otherwise, keep walking. Nothing to see here. Ride on. Costco's that way..",

He lost a job, his business, almost all friends (that's maybe a good thing after all) and almost lost me. The \"clientelle\" is rather friendly. The guards do not push above the roof. The food is bad, but there's commissary for a hundred bucks a week. Then you can \"pay\" the locals to cook something for you.He fought his case and \u00a0won a time served. What an experience.",

Many people may not know there is a federal prison so close by, but according to the Bureau of Prisons Website \u00a0this is an administrative facility capable of housing prisoners in all security levels, from violent offenders with possible high escape risk, to low risk security threats.",
