    "content": "This place wouldn't exist if not for our tax dollars and the people who work here probably went to night school to obtain a GED at best. They are rude, uncourteous and on a mission to make the visitors as uncomfortable as possible so we never want to come back. And for people who have the common misconception that federal prison has racket ball courts and a swimming pool, you're sorely mistaken. The inmates are treated like pit bulls at the pound for minor crimes (well at least the inmate I'm visiting). Praying my loved one gets transferred because this is a piece of hell.",

He called me his Mariah Carey. \u00a0When we made love, I hit new octaves. \u00a0Thank you metropolitan detention center for helping me find my boyfriend. \u00a0Not only do you serve food and an ass whooping, but you're a professional match making center!!!! \u00a0Can't ask for more than that.",

These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-Team.
