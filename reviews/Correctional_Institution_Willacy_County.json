Ask Edwin Rodriguez, 31, a contract security office who was recently charged with forcing himself on a female detainee. I say detainee because prisoners, at the minimum, have rights. I give this detention center a 1 star because:Fear of Rape by GuardsGetting taken to a dark corner and beatenCosts tax payers 1.7Billion dollars a yearDetainees have no access to civil libertiesIt's disgusting a facility like this exists.",
