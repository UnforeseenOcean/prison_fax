    "content": "ok, some \"good\" people make mistakes, do silly things and get punished for it w/the full weight of the law 'n very harshly i might add, but we won't abandon them... now that we have that out of the way i can start my review.this prison is nestled within a huge army base housing thousands of prisoners and it is not visitor friendly, first of all i think its only accessible by car which is a huge hassle for people w/o a car, a month b4 u plan to visit you have to register with the dept., then on the day u plan to visit u most double check the visiting hours for they might change on a whim, then when u actually enter the gate and they process your id, u park the car go into another building where u have to fill out a form requesting the visit, a small cramped room which is always overcrowded and stuffy where you'll spent at least an hour waiting, the room has some lockers where u can store the items they wont let through, then once u pass the second clearance u go into a smaller room awaiting escort into the prison visiting building, then after passing the third clearance, u enter the vising hall which is big and airy, where there are no tables but rows of plastic chairs where u can meet the person u came to visit and unlike other prisons u can walk around, hug the person u came to see and meet their friends and other celebrity prisoners i met george jung who's the person behind the movie blow by johnny depp. the room has a couple of vending machines and microwaves. your visit is not limited only to the visiting hours so if you are lucky and get in early u can stay with your loved ones for 5 hours plus.how can u rate a prison with stars??? ugh???",
