    "content": "It's a moral shame and it's a blessing of transparency. It's a moral shame because this is how a civilized society treats its convicted criminals. This building has the dark architecture of Kafka. It allows prisoners to see slits of sunlight but not to enjoy a full bath of it. The form of the building confesses its brutality. The shape allows it to be sort of a reverse of Foucault and Bentham's Panopticon, by allowing the prisoners a better view of society than society of them. A small percentage of people inside are innocent. A large percentage are guilty, but are serving sentences for non-violent offenses. The Bible and instinct teach us that \"an eye for an eye\" equates to justice. If someone commits a non-violent offense but their body is wrapped in concrete for years, is their punishment tailored to their crime? Have they imprisoned or harmed a body such that we ought to imprison and harm their body? It's a blessing of transparency because it does not disguise from mass public view how we treat human beings in a country that purports to believe in individual liberty and that \"all men are created equal.\" Has anyone murdered more innocent people in this world than Barack Obama or George W. Bush? Do the crimes of anyone inside this dungeon compare to their crimes? Will those two men or anyone who has abetted their crimes ever fear even the possibility of an indictment? All men are created equal, but society tears apart our natural equality and replaces it with prestigious degrees, abundant money, and influential positions. Those three tools create unequal legal outcomes. Intelligence Director James Clapper can lie to Congress but if Jamal lies to a low-level Cook County court, he will be locked away and painted as a lesion on society's skin. You can steal $50 billion dollars from the lower and middle classes if you work for a bank, but if you steal $50 from a banker in the Loop, you'll spend 10 years at this wonderful institution. This building is a moral shame and a blessing of transparency.",

A bit creepy to watch them pressed up against the metal gate peering down on the Loop, and also straight into my office. The courtyard has nice benches for eating lunch on during the summer; but the many pigeons and the feeling of being watched by prisoners can have adverse effects on ones appetite.",
